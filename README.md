## Branches

This repository consists of the following branches:

### [code](https://github.com/thecesrom/incendium/tree/code)

This branch will contain the source code for incendium's scripting functions.

### [project](https://github.com/thecesrom/incendium/tree/project)

This branch will contain the project folder structure as stored under `$IGNITION_DIR/data/projects`, and gives you the ability to get the latest code by cloning at the `projects` folder.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python 2.7.18 ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/))
* You are familiar with [Ignition 8.1 System Functions](https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/display/DOC81/System+Functions)

## Installation and usage

To use incendium, you may install it by doing any of the following.

### Installing with `pip`

The preferred method is to install it by running `pip`. It requires Python 2.7.18.

```bash
python2 -m pip install incendium
```

This will install it as package to your Python installation, which will allow you to call `incendium`'s Scripting functions from Python's REPL, and get code completion using an IDE (Pycharm or Visual Studio Code).

```bash
$ python2
Python 2.7.18 (default, Nov  9 2020, 16:23:15) 
[GCC Apple LLVM 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.21)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from __future__ import print_function
>>> import incendium.vision.gui

```

And to uninstall:

```bash
python2 -m pip uninstall incendium
```

### Downloading from releases
